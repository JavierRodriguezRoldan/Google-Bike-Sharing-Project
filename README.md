# Google Data Analytics Bike Sharing Capestone Project

This project is part of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered by google through Coursera.

It consists of cleaning and analysing the data of a fictitious Bike Sharing company in order to propose some advice or a plan of action to follow that will lead to more casual users becoming members. 

Useful information that you can find in the repository aswell:
  - Complete case study in the "Case study" file
  - Link to the raw and clean data  
  - Link to the Tableau visualizations I prepared
