# Google-Bike-Sharing-Project

This project is part of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered by google through Coursera.

It consists of cleaning and analysing the data of a fictitious Bike Sharing company in order to propose some advice or a plan of action to follow that will lead to more casual users becoming members.

Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
