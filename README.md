# Google-Bike-Sharing-Project

This project is part of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered by google through Coursera.

It consists of cleaning and analysing the data of a fictitious Bike Sharing company in order to propose some advice or a plan of action to follow that will lead to more casual users becoming members. For more detail please read the "Case Study" file (also included in the repository).

Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
