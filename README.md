# Google Data Analytics Bike Sharing Capestone Project

This project is part of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered by google through Coursera.

It consists of cleaning and analysing the data of a fictitious Bike Sharing company in order to propose some advice or a plan of action to follow that will lead to more casual users becoming members. 

## Useful information that you can find in the repository:

## Conclusions of the analysis:

  - The Docked bike is not used at all by members and little by casual users
  - Looking at the peak usage hours you can assume members ride to work in the morning and once they finish, while casual users do not go to work by bike but they do use it once they finish
  - Weenkends usage increases for casual users but decreases for members
  - Ride lenght is always longer for casual users, specially on weekends. Whereas ride lenght for members is stable throughout the year and for all days of the week
  - Summer is the time of the year with the most rides for both member types and winter the time with the least  
  - The most used station is by far "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave", specially by casual users
  
## Recommendations to get more casual users to get an annual membership:

  - Create packages or promotions including summer/weekends and also other less used months or time frames but at a price that can attract casual members to become members 
  - Disincentivise being a casual member by increasing the prices in summer, during the weenkeds or long trips so it is worhtwhile becoming a member. On the other hand, or these two combined, new members could be encouraged by promoting better prices on weekdays, short rides and in other months apart from summer
  - Advertise on the busiest station at the best possible time. This would be in Streeter Dr & Grand Ave station during summer months at around 5 pm
  - Maybe it is worth considering to stop investing in Docked bikes and replace them for either Electric or Classic ones, since both casual and members seem to prefer these other types of bicycle
